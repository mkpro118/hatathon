            <h2>What is Connectio?</h2>
            <br>Connectio was created to bring people together at their favorite events.
            Too often, people stay home instead of attending events because they donâ€™t
            want to go alone. Connectio assures these people that they will not be alone,
            helping them connect to others with the same interests who are attending
            the same events.
